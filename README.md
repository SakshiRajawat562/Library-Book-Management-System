# Library Book Management System (Python)

A simple Library Management System built in Python using the concepts of Linked List and Stack (for undo operations).  
This is a console-based mini project — suitable for students learning Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Features

- Add new books to the library
- Delete books by ID
- Search books by ID
- Display all books with availability status
- Issue a book (mark as issued)
- Return a book (mark as available)
- Undo last transaction (issue/return) using stack
- Linked List implementation for storing book records
- Stack implementation for transaction history

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Data Structures:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Stack (List-based)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
